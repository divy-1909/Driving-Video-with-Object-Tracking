# Driving Video with Object Tracking

This project demonstrates how to perform object tracking in driving videos, using computer vision techniques to identify and track objects in real-time. The project leverages the power of **OpenCV** and **Python** for object detection and tracking in video frames.

## Overview

In this project, we process driving video footage, track various objects (such as vehicles, pedestrians, etc.), and visualize their movement in the video. The project is useful for building automated systems for surveillance, traffic analysis, and autonomous driving systems.

## Features

- Object detection and tracking in video streams.
- Frame-by-frame analysis of driving videos.
- Real-time visualization of tracked objects.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV** - Library for computer vision tasks, including object tracking and image processing.
- **NumPy** - Used for handling arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib** - Used for visualization and plotting.

## Installation

To run the project, you need Python 3.x installed on your system along with the required libraries. You can install them using pip.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divy-1909/Driving-Video-with-Object-Tracking.git
cd Driving-Video-with-Object-Tracking
```

### 2. Install required libraries

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### 1. Run Object Tracking on a Video

The project contains a Python script to process a driving video and track objects.

```python
python track_objects.py --video "path_to_video.mp4"
```

- Replace `"path_to_video.mp4"` with the path to your own video file.

### 2. Output

The output will be a video with tracked objects, showing bounding boxes around the detected objects in each frame.

## Example

Here is an example of running the tracking on a driving video:
